# Illinois Domestic Violence Fatality Review

The Domestic Violence Fatality Review Committee is as an Ad Hoc Committee of the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Board. The Committee was established under the Illinois Domestic Violence Fatality Review Act in August 2021 to serve as a statewide resource for addressing domestic violence-related fatalities and near-fatalities, establish regional domestic violence fatality review teams, and issue annual recommendations for systems change. The Statewide Fatality Review Committee began meeting in January 2022 and continues to meet every other month to carry out its mission. All meetings are open to the public.
