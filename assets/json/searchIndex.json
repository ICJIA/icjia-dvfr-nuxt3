improving the administration of criminal justice. ICJIA brings together key leaders from the justice system and the public to identify critical issues faced by the criminal justice system in Illinois and to propose and evaluate policies, programs, and legislation that address those issues. The agency also works to ensure the criminal justice system in Illinois is efficient, effective, and equitable.\n\n[National Domestic Violence Fatality Review Initiative](https://www.ndvfri.org)&nbsp;&raquo;\n\nThe National Domestic Violence Fatality Review Initiative provides technical assistance for the review of domestic violence-related deaths in order to help prevent them in the future, preserve the safety of battered women, and hold accountable both the perpetrators of domestic violence and the multiple agencies and organizations that come into contact with the parties.\t\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV)](http://www.ncadv.org/)&nbsp;&raquo;\n\nThe National Coalition Against Domestic Violence’s mission is to lead, mobilize and raise voices to support efforts that demand a change in conditions that lead to domestic violence such as patriarchy, privilege, racism, sexism, and classism. NCADV is dedicated to supporting survivors and holding offenders accountable. \n\n[Illinois Crime Victims’ Compensation Act](https://ag.state.il.us/victims/cvc.html)&nbsp;&raquo;\n\nSurvivors of domestic violence-related crimes often face a long emotionally and physically painful road to recovery.
